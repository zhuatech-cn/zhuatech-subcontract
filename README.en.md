# ZhuaTech Subcontract

> A source-available enterprise project by [ZhuaTech](https://www.zhuatech.cn/) for supply chain, procurement, order, warehouse, and logistics operations.

ZhuaTech Subcontract provides a practical, self-hosted foundation for supply chain, procurement, order, warehouse, and logistics operations. It is designed for procurement, planning, warehouse, logistics, supplier, and operations teams, with clear business records, controlled workflows, operational visibility, and auditable actions.

This repository is intended for learning, technical evaluation, and non-commercial collaboration. The included implementation, tests, database resources, and container configuration provide a reproducible starting point for further enterprise adaptation.

**Search topics:** enterprise subcontract, self-hosted subcontract, Java Spring Boot enterprise software, digital transformation.

## Solution Overview

- **Primary users:** Procurement, planning, warehouse, logistics, supplier, and operations teams.
- **Deployment model:** Self-hosted, with container-based local deployment where supported.
- **Governance baseline:** Role-aware operations, validation, approval boundaries, exception handling, and auditability.
- **Production boundary:** Review security, identity, backup, observability, capacity, and compliance controls before production use.

## Business Coverage

- **Tenant Guard** — Manage tenant guard with ownership, validation, and explicit lifecycle states.
- **User** — Coordinate user through controlled workflows and approval gates.
- **Auth Session** — Track auth session metrics, exceptions, deadlines, and follow-up actions.
- **Business Record** — Preserve business record evidence in searchable, traceable operational history.
- **Audit Event** — Expose audit event in role-aware user and administration workspaces.
- **Idempotency Record** — Connect idempotency record to external systems through configurable integration boundaries.

## Implementation Stack

**Technology stack:** Java 21 · Spring Boot · Vue 3 · Vite · MySQL 8 · Docker Compose

### Repository Layout

- `backend/` — Java backend, domain services, APIs, validation, and automated tests
- `frontend/` — responsive user and administration interfaces
- `docs/` — architecture, operations, screenshots, and supporting documentation
- `scripts/` — repeatable local validation and maintenance scripts
- `compose.yaml` — local multi-service orchestration

## Local Deployment

```bash
docker compose --env-file .env.demo.example up -d --build
```
